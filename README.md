This is a tool to help you find quadratic equation vertex and points to graph completely written in c

If you are on a windows Operating System Then Run The exe beware the exe file requires the cygwin1.dll to run

if you are on Linux then to run this you can just compile the c file with gcc but put -lm example: ( gcc finding_the_vertex.c -o a.out -lm )

After compiling then running the compiled code it will create a text document called data.txt that after you enter the data will hold the vertex and some other points
